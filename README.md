Task Management Application
Overview
The Task Management Application allows users to add, edit, delete, and reorder tasks using a drag-and-drop interface. Tasks are categorized into three sections: To-Do, In Progress, and Done. The app ensures persistence by saving changes instantly to the database.

The UI is clean and minimalistic, fully responsive for both desktop and mobile users, and provides a smooth experience for task management.
